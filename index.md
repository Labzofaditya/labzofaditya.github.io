# Aditya Mishra
**Entrepreneur. Foodie**

I am currently building:
- [Panya Labs](https://www.panyalabs.com): A Startup in stealth
- [OCEN](https://www.ocen.dev): DPI from iSPIRT for MSME lending

Earlier, I have built:
- AMORQA (Sold to 4B Network),
- SwitchMe (Pivoted to AMORQA),
- Headstart (Flourishing!),
- Tata CRL (Absorbed into TCS),
- TCS COIN (Flourishing!) and
- Vista at IIM Bangalore (Merged into Venix).

I enjoy food, learning new things and meeting folks building interesting things. 

I write on:
1. Twitter
2. Substack
3. Here
