# Aditya Mishra
<p class="text-blue-000">
  <b>Entrepreneur. Foodie.</b>
</p>

I am currently building:
- [Panya Labs](https://www.panyalabs.com): A Startup in stealth
- [OCEN](https://www.ocen.dev): DPI from [iSPIRT](https://ispirt.in/) for MSME lending

Earlier, I have built:
- AMORQA (Sold to 4B Network),
- SwitchMe (Pivoted to AMORQA),
- [Headstart](https://www.headstart.in) (Flourishing!),
- [Tata CRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKA_(supercomputer)) ([Absorbed into TCS](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/press-release/tcs-enhance-high-performance-application-cloud-acquires-crl)),
- [TCS COIN](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/tcs-in-the-news/tcs-cointm) (Flourishing!) and
- Vista at IIM Bangalore ([Merged into Venix](https://www.iimb.ac.in/venix_2025)).

I enjoy food, learning new things and meeting folks building interesting things. 

This site is home to "accreted notes" on topics that I find interesting. Some of them are:
1. Production Function
2. Tragedy of Commons
3. India - Civilisation, State & Economy

This is different from my Substack which is more frequently updated and less digested/reflected. For eg, the notes from a single biography of a person would appear on my Substack. Here, you would find my analysis of his/her production function across various sources.
