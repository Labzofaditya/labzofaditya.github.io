# Aditya Mishra
**Entrepreneur. Foodie**

I am currently building:
- [Panya Labs](https://www.panyalabs.com): A Startup in stealth

Earlier, I have built:
- AMORQA (Sold to 4B Network),
- SwitchMe (Pivoted to AMORQA),
- [Headstart](https://www.headstart.in) (Flourishing!),
- [Tata CRL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EKA_(supercomputer)) ([Absorbed into TCS](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/press-release/tcs-enhance-high-performance-application-cloud-acquires-crl)),
- [TCS COIN](https://www.tcs.com/who-we-are/newsroom/tcs-in-the-news/tcs-cointm) (Flourishing!) and
- Vista at IIM Bangalore ([Merged into Venix](https://www.iimb.ac.in/venix_2025)).

I enjoy food, learning new things and meeting folks building interesting things.
